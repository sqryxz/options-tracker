## Implied Volatility Analysis

Implied volatility (IV) represents the market's expectation of future price movement and volatility. Higher IV indicates greater expected price movement and typically higher option premiums.

- **BTC Average IV**: 6033.51%
- **ETH Average IV**: 7961.88%

The IV spread between different strikes indicates market sentiment about potential price directions. A higher IV for out-of-the-money puts compared to calls suggests a bearish skew, while the opposite suggests a bullish skew.
